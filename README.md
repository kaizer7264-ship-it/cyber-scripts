# 🛡️ Cyber Scripts

A collection of cybersecurity scripts I’m building while learning and practicing.  
This repo documents my journey in Python for Cybersecurity, cloud security, and red teaming.

This repository will grow with more scripts, including:
- Web vulnerability scanners
- Network utilities
- Automation for red teaming labs
- Cloud security testing scripts
